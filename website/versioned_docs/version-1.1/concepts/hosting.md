# Hosting

## Self-Hosted

`zrok` is not limited to a managed offering. You can [host your own](/guides/self-hosting/linux/index.mdx) instance of `zrok` as well. `zrok` is
also freely available as open source software hosted by GitHub under a very permissive Apache v2 license.

## Managed Service

`zrok` is also offered as a cloud service, making it instantly accessible to a large population immediately.
NetFoundry provides a manged version of `zrok` at https://zrok.io. This provides the easy-to-use,
quick to demonstrate features of `zrok` without needing to deploy and host `zrok` yourself.
