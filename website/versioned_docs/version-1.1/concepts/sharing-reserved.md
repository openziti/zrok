# Reserved Shares

By default, a `public` or `private` share is assigned a _share token_ when you create a share using the `zrok share` command. The `zrok share` command is the bridge between your local environment and the users you are sharing with. When you terminate the `zrok share`, the bridge is eliminated and the _share token_ is deleted. If you run `zrok share` again, you will be allocated a brand new _share token_.

You can use a `reserved` share to persist your _share token_ across multiple runs of the `zrok share` bridge. When you use a `reserved` share, the share token will not be deleted between multiple runs of `zrok share`.

To use a `reserved` share, you will first run the `zrok reserve` command to create the reserved share (see `zrok reserve --help` for details). Once you've created your `reserved` share, you will use the `zrok share reserved` command (see `--help` for details) to run the bridge for the shared resource.

This pattern works for both `public` and `private` shares, and for all resource types supported by `zrok`.

To delete your `reserved` share use the `zrok release` command or click the delete button in the share's _Actions_ tab in the web console.

## Unique Names

The default is to generate a random _share token_ and you may instead specify a _unique name_. The unique name must be lowercase alphanumeric, between 4 and 32 characters in length.

This reserves public share token "toaster".

```bash title="Reserve with the Command Line"
zrok reserve public 80 --unique-name "toaster"
```

This shares `127.0.0.1:80` as `https://toaster.zrok.example.com` where `https://{token}.zrok.example.com` is the frontend's template.

```bash title="Share a Reserved Token"
zrok share reserved "toaster"
```
