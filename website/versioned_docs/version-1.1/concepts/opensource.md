# Open Source

It's important to the `zrok` project that it remain free and open source software. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openziti/zrok)
for the world to use, inspect, and build upon!

Check out the repository over on GitHub at [https://github.com/openziti/zrok](https://github.com/openziti/zrok).  If you find `zrok` to be useful, and
you want to help spread the word of `zrok` give the project a star. It really does help get the word out about the
project.

The project also uses a very permissive license: Apache v2. We encourage people to fork the repo and use `zrok` for your own purposes how you see fit or contribute back to the project.

## Built on OpenZiti

The power of `zrok` really lies in `private` sharing. It's increasingly clear that security needs to be a first-class
member of any organization. To enable `private` sharing, `zrok` was built on top of another excellent open source project named OpenZiti.

OpenZiti is a secure overlay network focusing on bringing zero trust to applications. It is the __backbone__ of `zrok`.
In fact, `zrok` proudly proclaims itself as an Ziti _native_ application.

If you are interested in learning more about OpenZiti head over to [the docs](https://docs.openziti.io/docs/learn/introduction/), try the quickstart, and don't forget to star that project too. We couldn't build `zrok` without OpenZiti!
