title: Invitations
---

This is how to set up self-service invitations for your users to get an account on your self-hosted zrok instance.

## Overview

- You can create user accounts directly with the `zrok admin create account` CLI or API instead of inviting them.
- You can welcome users to invite themselves via email.
- To enable self-service invitations you must also configure the controller to send email.
- You can require an invitation token if you want to restrict self-service.

## The Self-Service User Experience

This is what your users will do.

```bash
zrok invite
```

```buttonless title="Output"
enter and confirm your email address...

> user@domain.com
> user@domain.com

[ Submit ]

invitation sent to 'user@domain.com'!
```

## How it Works

The `zrok invite` command presents a small form that allows you to enter (and then confirm) your email address. Tabbing to the `[ Submit ]` button will start the invitation process.

Next, check the email where you sent the invite. You should receive a message asking you to click a link to create your `zrok` account. When you click that link, you will be brought to a web page that will allow you to set a password for your new account.

Enter a password and its confirmation, and click the `Register Account` button. You'll see the following:

For now, we'll ignore the "enable your shell for zrok" section. Just click the `zrok web portal` link:

After clicking the `Log In` button, you'll be brought into the `zrok` _web console_:

Congratulations! Your `zrok` account is ready to go!
