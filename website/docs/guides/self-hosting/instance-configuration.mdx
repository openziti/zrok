title: Use Another zrok Instance
sidebar_label: Instance Config
---

:::note
This guide is relevant if you are self-hosting or using a friend's `zrok` instance instead of using zrok-as-a-service from `zrok.io`.
:::

The `zrok` *command* on your computer uses a `zrok` *instance* over the network.

The default instance API endpoint for the `zrok` command is `api-v2.zrok.io`. Set the API endpoint to another instance's API endpoint:

```text
zrok2 config set apiEndpoint https://zrok.example.com
```

```buttonless title="Output"
[WARNING]: unable to open environment metadata; ignoring

zrok configuration updated
```

:::note
The `WARNING` about `environment metadata` is expected when you run `zrok2 config set` before `zrok2 enable`.
:::

You can use the `zrok2 status` command to inspect the state of your local _environment_. `zrok` refers to each shell where you install and `enable` a copy of `zrok` as an _environment_.

```text
zrok2 status
```

```buttonless title="Output"
Config:

 CONFIG       VALUE                      SOURCE 
 apiEndpoint  https://zrok.mydomain.com  config 

[WARNING]: Unable to load your local environment!

To create a local environment use the zrok2 enable command.
```

The `zrok2 status` command shows the configured API service that your environment is using, as well as the `SOURCE` where the setting was retrieved. In this case, `config` means that the setting was set into the environment using the `zrok2 config` command.
