# Concepts

`zrok` was designed to make sharing local resources both secure and easy. In this section of the `zrok` documentation, we'll tour through all of the most important features.

Sharing with `zrok` can be either [`public`](./sharing-public.mdx) or [`private`](./sharing-private.mdx). For persistent shares, see [reserved names and namespaces](./sharing-reserved.md).

Naturally, regular web-based resources can be shared but `zrok` also includes support for sharing raw [TCP](./tunnels.md) and [UDP](./tunnels.md) network connections, and also includes a [website and file sharing](./files.md) feature.

Learn about `zrok` [hosting here](./hosting.md), including instructions on how to [install your own `zrok` instance](/guides/self-hosting/linux/index.mdx).

:::tip migrating from v1.x
If you're upgrading from zrok v1.x, see the [v2 migration guide](/guides/v2-migration-guide.md) to learn about the new namespace and name system that replaces reserved shares.
