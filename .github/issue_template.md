*** IMPORTANT: THIS ISSUE DATABASE IS NOT FOR SUPPORT ***

If you think you have found a bug in zrok, or you need help with a specific issue, please reach out for support on the OpenZiti Discourse group at:

https://openziti.discourse.group/

There is a zrok topic available there. You can use your GitHub credentials to log in. The entire zrok and OpenZiti team are monitoring that forum. They're not monitoring this issue database. If you decide to open an issue here anyway, we're probably still going to guide you to the Discourse forum to assist you. Going there first will get you help faster. :-)

This issue database is for vetted roadmap items and confirmed bugs within the core open-source portion of zrok.
