# You MUST enable a zrok environment by setting the environment enable token here. This file must be readable by
# 'other'.  Obtain the enable token from the zrok console after accepting your invitation and creating a password.
#
# WARNING: changing these values has no effect if /var/lib/zrok-share/.zrok/environment.json exists. Remove that file to
# enable a new environment and /var/lib/zrok-share/.zrok/reserved.json to provision a new frontend URL for the specified
# target.

## ZROK BACKEND TARGET

# You MUST define the backend target and mode. The frontend URL will be provisioned when the service starts. You MAY
# change ZROK_TARGET and frontend URL will remain the same after a restart as long as the backend mode and frontend

# WARNING. You may delete /var/lib/zrok-share/.zrok/reserved.json and restart the service to provision a new frontend URL.
