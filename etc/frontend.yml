# The `v` field determines the configuration version. When software is released that changes the structure of the

# Setting the `host_match` setting will cause a `zrok access public` to ignore `Host` headers that do not contain the
# configured string. This will allow you to let a load balancer access the frontend by IP address for health check
# purposes, and will allow `Host` headers that match the configured DNS name to be routed through `zrok`.

# Configure interstitial pages for this frontend. The interstitial page presents a warning to internet users, alerting
# them to the fact that they're visiting a zrok share.
#
#interstitial:
#  # Enable or disable interstitial pages on this frontend.
#  #
#  enabled: true
#
#  # Specify a path to an external HTML file containing the interstitial page. 
#  # See `endpoints/publicProxy/interstitialUi/index.html` for details on how the page works.
#  #
#  html_path: /some/path/to/interstitial.html
# 
#  # Specify a list of User-Agent prefixes that should receive the interstitial page. If interstitial pages are enabled
#  # and this list is not set, all user agents will receive an interstitial page.

# The OAuth configuration is used when enabling OAuth authentication with your public frontend.

#oauth:
#  # `bind_address` is the <address:port> of the interface where the OAuth frontend listener should
#  # bind
#  #
#  bind_address: 127.0.0.1:8181
#
#  # `redirect_url` is the <scheme://address[:port]> of the URL where OAuth requests should be directed.
#  #
#  redirect_url: https://oauth.zrok.io
#
#  # `cookie_domain` is the domain where the authentication cookies should be applied. Should likely match
#  # the `host_match` specified above.
#  #
#  cookie_domain: zrok.io
#
#  # `hash_key` is a unique key for your installation that is used to secure authentication payloads
#  # with OAuth providers.
#  #
#  hash_key: "<yourRandomHashKey>"
#
#  # `providers` contains an array of provider details enabled in your installation. Currently only
#  # `google` and `github` are supported. Your configuration can include `google`, `github`, or both.
