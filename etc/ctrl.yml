# The `v` field determines the configuration version. When software is released that changes the structure of the
# configuration, the software will expect this field to be incremented. This protects you against invalid configuration
# versions and will refer to you to the documentation when the configuration structure changes.

# `fabric.usage` events are consumed and then sent into `zrok`. For production environments, we recommend that you use

# forward the events to an AMQP queue for consumption by multiple `zrok` controllers.
